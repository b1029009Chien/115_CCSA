```prompt
---
description: Produce a planning outline and steps for the feature described in the PR/issue.
---

When the user triggers `/paln`, generate a development plan that breaks the feature into tasks with estimates and dependencies.

Output requirements:
- High-level plan (2-4 steps)
- Task list with short descriptions (3-8 items)
- Suggested ordering and dependencies
- Rough time estimates per task (short/medium/long)

Keep it pragmatic and actionable for a small team to start implementing.
```
