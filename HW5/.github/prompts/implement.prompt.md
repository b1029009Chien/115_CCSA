description: Provide concrete implementation steps and code-level guidance for the feature.
---

When the user triggers `/implement`, produce practical implementation guidance: suggested files to modify, high-level algorithm or API calls, and a small code snippet if appropriate.

Output requirements:
- Files/modules likely to change
- High-level algorithm or sequence of steps
- Minimal example snippet (language-agnostic where possible)
- Potential pitfalls and integration notes

Keep the output succinct and developer-focused.
```
