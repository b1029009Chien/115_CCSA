# Database Design and Infrastructure Specification

## Database Service Configuration

### Placement Strategy
- **Constraint**: Database service is configured to run on specific nodes labeled with role=db
- **Purpose**: Ensures database runs on nodes with appropriate resources and isolation
- **Implementation**: 
  ```yaml
  deploy:
    placement:
      constraints:
        - node.labels.role==db
  ```

### Storage Configuration
- **Volume Type**: Named volume `dbdata`
- **Mount Point**: `/var/lib/postgresql/data`
- **Persistence**: Data persists across container restarts and service updates
- **Implementation**:
  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - dbdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  ```

## Network Configuration

### Overlay Network
- **Network Name**: `appnet`
- **Type**: Overlay network for multi-host container communication
- **Scope**: Internal communication between services
- **Access Pattern**:
  - API service → Database: Direct access via overlay network
  - Web service → API service: Proxied through nginx
  - External → Web service: Via published port 80

### Service Communication
- Database is not directly exposed to external networks
- Services communicate using Docker DNS service discovery
- Database accessible internally as `db:5432`

## Risk Analysis and Mitigation

### Data Persistence Risks
1. **Volume Loss**
   - Risk: Data loss if volume is accidentally deleted
   - Mitigation: Regular backups, clear procedures for volume management
   - Recovery: Documented restore procedures

2. **Node Failure**
   - Risk: Service disruption if db node fails
   - Mitigation: Node health monitoring, failover planning
   - Impact: Temporary service outage until manual intervention

### Network Risks
1. **Network Partition**
   - Risk: Services unable to communicate if overlay network fails
   - Mitigation: Health checks, automatic service recovery
   - Detection: `/healthz` endpoint monitors database connectivity

2. **Security Risks**
   - Risk: Unauthorized database access
   - Mitigation: 
     - Database only accessible within overlay network
     - No exposed external ports
     - Credentials managed via environment variables

### Operational Considerations
1. **Volume Management**
   - Clear procedures for volume cleanup required
   - Volume removal requires SSH access to host
   - Fresh deployments need volume removal coordination

2. **Service Updates**
   - Database updates require careful version management
   - Consider data migration needs for version upgrades
   - Plan maintenance windows for major updates

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Security**
   - Database credentials in environment variables
   - No direct external database access
   - Services isolated in overlay network

2. **Reliability**
   - Health check endpoints for monitoring
   - Placement constraints for resource allocation
   - Volume persistence for data durability

3. **Maintainability**
   - Clear service separation
   - Documented network architecture
   - Standard Docker Swarm practices

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**
   - Consider replication for read scaling
   - Evaluate backup automation needs
   - Plan for data volume growth

2. **Monitoring**
   - Add metrics collection
   - Implement advanced health checks
   - Consider log aggregation

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Implement secrets management
   - Add network policy controls
   - Regular security audits
